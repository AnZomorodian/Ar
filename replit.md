## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Bootstrap 5
- **Visualization**: Chart.js with custom chart configurations for F1-specific analytics
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design with custom CSS theming
- **Color Scheme**: Dark theme with Formula 1 racing aesthetics (primary green: #00ff88)
- **Interactive Elements**: Canvas-based track visualization, dynamic chart updates, real-time data filtering

### Backend Architecture
- **Web Framework**: Flask (Python) - lightweight and suitable for data analytics applications
- **Data Processing**: FastF1 library for Formula 1 telemetry data access and processing
- **Scientific Computing**: NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- **Interpolation**: SciPy for telemetry data smoothing and interpolation
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints returning JSON data for frontend consumption

### Session Management
- **Configuration**: Environment-based secret key management
- **Security**: Basic Flask session handling for user state management

## Key Components

### Data Management
- **FastF1 Integration**: Direct access to official F1 timing and telemetry data
- **Grand Prix Calendar**: Comprehensive year-by-year race schedule data (2018-2025)
- **Session Types**: Support for all F1 session types (Race, Qualifying, Practice sessions, Sprint events)
- **Caching Strategy**: FastF1 built-in caching for performance optimization

### Analytics Engine
- **Telemetry Processing**: Real-time processing of speed, throttle, brake, and position data
- **Driver Comparison**: Multi-driver telemetry overlay and comparative analysis
- **Track Visualization**: Canvas-based track rendering with telemetry overlay capabilities
- **Performance Metrics**: Lap time analysis, sector comparisons, and speed trap data

### User Interface Components
- **Session Selector**: Year, Grand Prix, and session type selection interface
- **Driver Management**: Dynamic driver loading and selection system
- **Chart Visualization**: Multiple chart types for different data perspectives
- **Track Canvas**: Interactive track map with telemetry visualization overlay

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User selects year, Grand Prix, and session through web interface
2. **Data Retrieval**: Flask backend uses FastF1 to fetch session data from F1 API
3. **Data Processing**: Backend processes telemetry data, applies interpolation, and formats for frontend
4. **API Response**: Processed data sent to frontend as JSON via AJAX requests
5. **Visualization**: Frontend JavaScript renders charts and track visualizations using Chart.js
6. **Interactivity**: Real-time updates based on user selections and driver filtering

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **FastF1**: Primary F1 data access library - provides official timing and telemetry data
- **Flask**: Web framework for backend API and template rendering
- **NumPy/Pandas**: Scientific computing and data manipulation
- **SciPy**: Advanced mathematical functions for data interpolation

### Frontend Libraries
- **Chart.js**: Primary charting library with date-fns adapter for time series
- **Bootstrap 5**: UI framework for responsive design
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for user interface elements

### Data Sources
- **F1 Official API**: Via FastF1 library for telemetry and timing data
- **Ergast API**: Potential integration for historical race results (implied by calendar structure)

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Session Management**: Environment variable-based secret key configuration
- **Development**: Flask development server with debug logging enabled
- **Caching**: FastF1 cache directory management for persistent data storage

### File Structure
- **Static Assets**: Organized CSS and JavaScript files for maintainable frontend code
- **Templates**: Flask template system for server-side rendering
- **Application Logic**: Modular Python structure with clear separation of concerns

### Scalability Considerations
- **Caching Strategy**: FastF1 built-in caching reduces API calls and improves performance
- **Modular Frontend**: Separate JavaScript modules for charts and main application logic
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap for cross-device compatibility

### Performance Optimization
- **Data Processing**: Server-side telemetry processing to reduce frontend computational load
- **Asset Management**: Organized static file structure for efficient browser caching
- **Chart Rendering**: Optimized Chart.js configurations for smooth real-time updates
